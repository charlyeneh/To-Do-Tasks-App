# TO-DO Task App

> In this project, I built a simple TO-DO list App. The project has three milestones:
1. The list  structure - Majorly the HTML markup.
2. Interactive list -Making the App interactive and adding basic functionalities.
3. Add and Remove - To be able to add and remove tasks in the app.

 This was achieved using plain JavaScript with objects and arrays, that allows users to add/remove tasks from a list.
